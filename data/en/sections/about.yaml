summary: 'I am a data analyst with 2 and a half years of working experience at NORC at the University of Chicago.

In my job I work in languages like R and Julia for an array of purposes like data cleaning, data visualisation, statistical analysis, and machine learning. I also work with tools like R Shiny, D3, and Illustrator for the development of web applications, infographics, and webpages. In my free time, I like to cook, bake, and brew beer!'
